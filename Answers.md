1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS (Database Management System)

DBMS Components:
Database Engine: Handles data storage, retrieval, and updating.
Database Schema: Defines the structure of the database.
Query Processor: Interprets and executes queries.
Transaction Management: Ensures consistency and handles transactions.
Data Dictionary: Stores metadata about the database.

2. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.

A relational database stores data in tables (relations) with rows and columns.
Examples:
MySQL
Oracle
Microsoft SQL Server
PostgreSQL

3. State and Explain three classifications of SQL

DDL (Data Definition Language): Defines database structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
DML (Data Manipulation Language): Deals with data manipulation (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
DCL (Data Control Language): Controls access to data (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).

4. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?

Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Foreign Key: A key that links two tables by referring to the primary key of another table.

5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities in a database and the relationships between them.

6. What are the advantages of relational databases?

Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency.
Flexibility: Easy to update and query data.
Security: Data access is controlled.
Normalization: Minimizes data redundancy.

7. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?

INTEGER: Stores whole numbers.
VARCHAR: Stores variable-length text.
DATE: Stores date values.
FLOAT: Stores floating-point numbers.

8. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?

The purpose of a DBMS is to efficiently manage, store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a structured format, ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility.
